#+TITLE: CHIL: Constructing Hardware in Lisp

* CHIL --- Constructing Hardware in Lisp

Based on the ideas of parameterized hardware with higher-level type-checking from [[https://chisel-lang.org][Chisel]] and [[https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/nano-jfp.pdf][Nanopass Compiler Construction]].
In addition, the highly malleable Lisp family of languages can allow for syntactic extensions that would be very difficult in Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL, or simply difficult in Scala and Chisel.

* Why?
I personally felt this when specialty connection operators were required to be defined as experimental in chisel3; operators which I needed to connect hardware together.
