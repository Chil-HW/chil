simulators.

@chapter Introduction

@cindex purpose
Chil has multiple goals with many lofty goals.
Some or none of these may ever come to pass.

@enumerate
@item
Create and define an embedded domain-specific language@tie{}(EDSL), that
allows for expressing hardware in a reusable and composable way.
@item
Writing out a Chil design to another Hardware Description
Language@tie{}(HDL), whether it be Verilog, VHDL, FIRRTL, CIRCT, or any
other.
@item
When lowering a design from Chil's syntax to another language, use a
nanopass framework for optimizations, to make understanding a single
optimization easier and make adding additional optimization passes
simpler.
@item
Create a digital logic simulator that supports snapshotting, interactive
debugging, and time travel.
@item
Include a verification system to formally verify a design in the same
language as the design is written in.
@item
Synthesize to hardware, if possible.
@end enumerate

@section Writing Documentation

To render documentation, you must first make sure that you ran both
@command{./bootstrap} and @command{./configure} in your source tree.
After that you can run one of the following commands:

@itemize
@item @samp{make info} to compile the Info manual.
      You can check it with @command{info doc/chil.info}.
@item @samp{make doc/chil.info} to compile the Info manual.
      You can check it with @command{info doc/chil.info}.
@item @samp{make html} to compile the HTML version.
      You can point your browser to the relevant file in the
      @file{doc/chil.html} directory.
@item @samp{make doc/chil.html} to compile the HTML version.
      You can point your browser to the relevant file in the
      @file{doc/chil.html} directory.
